    I joined Moo at the beginning of a massive project to migrate from hosted tin to AWS. This involved jumping in at the deep-end with Terraform and Ansible, and was pretty much all I worked on until July 2017, when we pulled the trigger on a remarkably smooth cut-over.

    The rest of the summer was spent on cleaning-up some things we'd kicked down the road during the migration project, and since September I've been on a project to build a Kubernetes-based self-service platform.

    My role at the ODI encompassed many things - initially, leading on the building and maintenance of all of the [test-driven Chef infrastructure](https://github.com/theodi/chef-skellington) for the ODI's first round of core tools, primarily [Open Data Certificates](http://toolbox.theodi.org/tools/certificates/) and [CSV Lint](http://toolbox.theodi.org/tools/csvlint/), and our [adoption of GDS's CMS suite](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5181-adventures-in-early-adoption-of-open-source-code).

    Subsequent highlights include:

      * Gaining a comprehensive grasp of HTTP and REST (mainly from working under the guidance of [Jeni Tennison](https://theodi.org/team/jeni-tennison))
      * Learning to love TDD, primarily through heavy exposure to RSpec and Cucumber
      * Embracing the Github -> Travis -> Heroku continuous deployment chain
      * Building front-end apps (e.g. the TfL [Train Data Demonstrator](http://goingunderground.herokuapp.com/)) and so getting a handle on Bootstrap, JavaScript, Sass and D3
      * Providing technical mentoring for one of our PhD students from the [WDAqua](http://wdaqua.eu/) programme
      * Occasional speaking engagements, primarily on the subject of Working In The Open

    *Everything* we ever built at the ODI has been built in the open and all of our code is [up on Github](https://github.com/theodi).

    Working closely with AMEE's relatively small team of Java and Ruby devs, I was responsible for:

      AMEE's config management previously consisted of a handful of bash scripts
    * Deploying and configuring Splunk
    * Migrating several of AMEE's legacy apps from leased iron in a DC to AWS

    alongside the usual SysAdmin work of backup-and-restore, capacity planning, etc.

    VisualDNA is a dynamic startup based in Soho. The company generates profiles for users
    through the use of visual quizzes, working with clients including the LA Times,
    match.com and the Daily Mirror.
  profile:  |
    My role at VisualDNA was pretty much DevOps before I knew that DevOps was even a thing
    – as a busy startup with diverse client projects there were often multiple
    deploys per day, meaning I had to work very closely with the developers to
    make sure we were all on the same page.

    This close working relationship was particularly fruitful during the gradual
    transfer of many of VisualDNA’s core services from the legacy platform (a
    couple of racks of Linux boxes in a London datacentre) to Amazon Web Services.
    The back-and-forth between myself and the development team was invaluable as
    we iterated through various combinations of EC2 Instance Types to find the
    setup that best fitted our requirements.

    The transfer to AWS accelerated rapidly during 2011; the setup I left them with included:

    * A 16-node Cassandra cluster
    * A 6-node Hadoop cluster
    * Several groups of Elastic-Load-Balanced web servers

    This platform is still in production use, including an all-new Quiz Engine
    which as far as I know is still performing extremely well.

    During my time at VisualDNA I also:

    * Completely rewrote the legacy deployment system (in Python), and subsequently
      repurposed a lot of this code to handle AWS deploy
    * Introduced the MMM multi-master replication manager for MySQL on the
      front-end database servers
    * Cleaned-up and reorganised the Subversion repositories (the better to
      integrate with my new deploy system)
    * Managed a migration from Akamai EdgeControl to Amazon Cloudfront
    * Substantially rewrote the ‘event-tracking and processing’ system
    * Managed a migration from hosted Exchange email to Google Mail

    Rex Features is Britain’s leading independent photographic press agency and
    picture library. Rex supplies a daily service of news, celebrity, features,
    and stock photos to all national newspapers, magazines, TV, web and other
    media in the UK and in more than 30 countries worldwide.
  profile:  |
    My work at Rex covered the usual gamut of Sysadmin tasks, including: backup
    and recovery, webserver administration, DNS management, plenty of scripting
    (mostly in bash), patching servers, and writing and maintaining documentation.
    There was also some SQL Server admin, and a certain amount of desktop support –
    Rex is a company of ~80 employees, supported by an IT department of four.
    All new server hardware passed through my hands for installation and configuration.

    When I joined Rex, the IT department consisted of two very busy people. The
    IT infrastructure had been growing rapidly, deployment had happened on a
    seemingly ad-hoc basis, and documentation was fairly sparse. My initial tasks included:

    * Installing a CVS server (yes, this was 2003) and gathering code and scripts into it
    * Rolling out the Amanda backup system and setting up a proper backup and recovery scheme
    * Getting the RT ticketing system up and running (we later moved to Jira)
    * Beginning the process of documenting everything in Twiki (we subsequently migrated to Mediawiki)

    Subsequently, I was directly involved in:

    * Setting up the Nagios network monitoring system
    * Migrating the internal mail from Novell to Exchange, and later outsourcing
      this function to Cobweb’s hosted Exchange platform
    * Configuring VPNs between Rex’s headquarters and various locations – initially
      using isakmpd on OpenBSD, and latterly on a Watchguard Firebox
    * Overseeing the transfer of Rex’s image data – 5 terabytes of jpegs at the
      time of writing – from a cluster based on a number of FreeBSD servers to a
      set of Network Appliance 3050 filers
    * Configuring and deploying Alteon load-balancers for the Rex website, which
      gets ~1.5 million hits and shifts ~13 gigs of data a day
    * Migrating Rex’s code from CVS to Subversion
    * Specifying and documenting a “standard Rex server install” – except for a
      handful of Windows servers, the whole of Rex’s server room and colo are
      running FreeBSD, so the standard install is a set of common ports and a
      number of scripts

    Rex went on to acquire another picture agency in Los Angeles, which brought
    about a project to integrate their image archive into Rex’s, modifying the
    server software to enable them to use the Rex client application, and
    deploying a new set of servers to support of all of this. The final setup
    consisted of a redundant pair of Microsoft SQL servers, a set of NetApp
    filers and shelves, and a group of FreeBSD servers (running apache and mod_perl)
    serving up three websites and a range of internal webservices, all sitting
    behind a pair of Alteon load-balancers.

    Empower Interactive was a telecoms software startup, founded in 2000 in the
    City of London.
  profile:    |
    Having joined Empower at its inception, my initial responsibilities were to
    design and implement the IT infrastructure necessary to support the operations
    of the fledgling business. This included: network planning; server acquisition
    and installation (various internal servers, external mail server, firewall, etc);
    deploying a backup and recovery scheme; managing the website; and a great deal
    of user education. I also got involved in many other aspects of the business –
    this was a tiny start-up, so I found myself doing testing, writing user manuals
    for Empower’s products, and even doing a little Java.

    I was solely responsible for supporting this infrastructure for the first year,
    until the business expanded to the extent that further IT staff were required.
    I was asked to set up an IT department, and recruited another Sysadmin who
    specialised in Windows; the team continued to expand over the following years.
    I gained experience with Solaris 8, HP-UX and qualified as an Oracle administrator
    in order to install some of Empower’s products onto carrier-grade hardware;
    I also assisted with deploying the hardware into telcos.

    Empower unfortunately ceased trading in November 2006.
